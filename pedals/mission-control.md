<p>The Mission Control Patch Bay allows you to take full control over your pedalboard's routing and layout. Connnect each pedal to a patch, then route them into each other in whatever way you want using the synth-style 1/8in patch cables, without having to move the pedals themselves.</p>
<br>
<p>The Mission Control is fully passive - no power required. This simple, straightforward tool is the perfect centerpiece for your pedalboard in the studio, the practice space, or even a music shop display. Set up your perfect layout once, and then leave it as-is while trying different positions for your reverb and delay, your wah, or even swapping pedals in and out of your amp's FX loop.</p>

<p>Custom graphics, labels, and layouts are available upon request. </p>
