<p>Hailing from the lineage of Vox, Shin-Ei, and Boss, the Hyborian Age is an intense, old school fuzz with a naturally occurring octave up.  With a monstrous amount of gain on tap and an intense 2-band EQ, this fuzz is ideal for both frying your speakers through a clean amp, or pushing your favorite tube head into meltdown.  Doesn't clean up nicely, because why would you even want that?</p>
